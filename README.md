# Zero-Bug-Video-App
Our web app focuses on seeking certain topics out of large content video using keywords we have also created android app player that plays offline videos using voice command
The major problem addressed by this project is it allows users to learn and re-learn their required topics without much hassle where usually a course video is of a course time of 40-45 hours and the user has to go through the entire course to find their required topic whereas in this app the user can just mention the topic and the user will be prompted of the video tracks of the given inputted topic and the user can select where to seek the video through. In our android app player we have developed a system where the user does not need to search his entire file storage to play a particular video, instead he can give a voice command mentioning the filename and the video will start playing automatically offline.
